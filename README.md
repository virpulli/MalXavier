MalXavier, stands for Malcolm of Xavier.

Malcolm is an English person's name with implied meaning of "Preacher", of which "Mal" is the pet name.

Xavier is also an English person's name, with implied meaning of "Rays of the Light".

I use such name to honor the free bright spirit in such a dark world.
